Help generating a schedule for daily yoga practise.

I practise daily yoga at home, where I typically practise via classes on youtube. Yoga with Adrienne provides themed [monthly calendars](https://yogawithadriene.com/calendar/), but these classes don't always fit with my schedule. I want to cherry pick classes from the monthly calendar (to get a feel of the theme), whilst creating my own practice schedule using my favourite videos. 
I've been doing this manually until now; I'm going to automate it with Java instead!

-----

## My Specifications

- Request a number of classes I want to schedule
- Specify the type of class I want to do
- Add classes I like to the pool of available classes
- Categorise classes in the pool of available classes
- Add specific one-off classes on an ad-hoc basis
- Create a practise calendar for the coming month
- Click the calendar to go to today's class
- Classes shouldn't be repeated in the same month
- Unless no unique classes are available, classes shouldn't be scheduled on consecutive months
